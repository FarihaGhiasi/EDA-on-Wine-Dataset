# Exploratory Data Analysis on Wine Dataset

Description: This repository contains code and documentation for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a wine dataset. The dataset consists of information on red and white types of wine, including their chemical properties and quality ratings. The purpose of this analysis is to gain insights into the relationships between various wine attributes and their quality ratings.

The repository includes Jupyter notebooks with Python code for data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis. The EDA covers descriptive statistics, data visualization, correlation analysis, and feature selection. The findings are summarized in a report that includes insights and recommendations for future analysis.

The repository is organized into the following directories:

data: containing the raw and cleaned datasets.
notebooks: containing the Jupyter notebooks for data analysis.
reports: containing the EDA report.
This repository can serve as a starting point for anyone interested in exploring the wine dataset or performing EDA on similar datasets. Contributions and feedback are welcome.
